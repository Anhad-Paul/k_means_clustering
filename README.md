# k_means_clustering
This is a project involving the K-Means Clustering Algorithm undertaken during my first year of university. The algorithm begins with a random seed point and clusters data together into k distinct groups. This allows uploaded pictures with hundreds of colours to have their pixels clustered into k distinct colour groups to give an output of a picture with only those k colours. I have attached the MATLAB code to this project within this repository. To run the algorithm, open and run the ConvertImage.m script and follow the prompted instructions. I have uploaded default images into the file to allow you to efficiently observe the results. However, if you wish to use your own pictures, ensure they are of appropriate size due to potentially excessive runtimes.
